Only the latest version of the last two versions of ReSharper are going to be supported.

In other words, at the time of writing, the latest version of ReSharper 5.x is 5.1.3000
and the latest released version of 6 is 6.0 RTM. Both of these are currently supported.
ReSharper 6.1 is currently in EAP, and will also have support. Once 6.1 is finished,
6.0 RTM support will be dropped.

The source code is still in the repo, so if you want to build previous versions, see
the following tags:

4.1, 4.5, 5.0: xunitcontrib-resharper 0.4.1
