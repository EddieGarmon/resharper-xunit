ReSharper 6.0
-------------

1. Skipped tests not currently displayed in grey before run
2. Tests failing in fixture constructor should fail child tests
3. Usage analysis is currently broken:
   a. Test classes are not marked as in use during Solution Wide Analysis
      (includes parents of nested test classes, although this is the same with nunit)
   b. Properties used by PropertyDataAttribute are not marked as in use
   c. Non test methods (e.g. private methods marked with [Fact]) are incorrectly marked as in use
4. ConcreteBaseClass test doesn't include BaseTestMethod as child test
5. DerivedFromAbstractBaseClass test doesn't run AbstractBaseTestMethod. Should it? Does xunit?
6. Tests from base classes not currently being displayed correctly in test explorer
   (should display Base.TestMethod, but just displays TestMethod)

1. How to support DisplayName?
2. How to support RunWith?
3. How to support traits/categories?
4. How to support Theory tests?
5. InvalidFactMethod + AmbiguousMethodNames tests. Should these be marked as tests? xunit will run
   them, but will fail (if the xunit sdk identifies them as tests, we should display them as tests)
